# BarberBook

BarberBook is a native SwiftUI + SwiftData demo that helps a shop manage bookings, waitlists, and loyalty without any web backend. Everything runs locally, with an easy path to enable CloudKit syncing later.

## Architecture
- **SwiftUI, iOS 17+** scene with a tabbed layout for bookings, waitlist, clients, and loyalty.
- **SwiftData** models (`@Model`) for `Barber`, `Service`, `Client`, `Booking`, `WaitlistEntry`, and `Haircut`.
- **MVVM-inspired layers**: lightweight `ViewModel` types encapsulate business logic such as clash detection, wait-time math, and haircut storage.
- **Local notifications** handled by `NotificationManager`, which schedules one-hour reminders for upcoming bookings after permission is granted.
- **Seed data** loads once on first launch via `SeedDataService` so the UI has meaningful content immediately.

## Data Model
- **Barber**: profile + active flag; new avatar support so staff can add profile photos from the Settings tab.
- **Service**: name, duration, price. Duration drives overlap checks and wait-time estimates and can be fully managed from the in-app Services tab.
- **Client**: notes, phone, visit count, relationships to bookings and haircut history.
- **Booking**: links client, barber, and service; stores start date/time, derived end time, status for loyalty tracking, and a `paymentStatus` for Apple Pay progress.
- **WaitlistEntry**: timestamped queue with status to mark served/cancelled.
- **Haircut**: timestamped entry with optional photo URL saved locally via `PhotoStorageService`.
- **PaymentStatus**: lightweight enum (`unpaid`, `pending`, `paid`, `failed`) that keeps the UI in sync with the last Apple Pay attempt per booking.
- **PaymentLink**: stores reusable Cash App / PayPal / Venmo / custom links plus an optional QR image so barbers can share alternate payment methods.

All models live inside `Models/Entities.swift` and are automatically registered inside `Persistence/PersistenceController.swift`.

## Enabling CloudKit Later
The app currently ships with on-device storage only. To enable iCloud syncing:
1. Open the project in Xcode and enable the **iCloud** capability with **CloudKit**.
2. Create a CloudKit container (for example `iCloud.com.yourteam.BarberBook`).
3. Update `PersistenceController` to build a `ModelConfiguration` that passes `cloudKitContainerIdentifier` and `.private` (or `.public`) database according to your needs.
4. Rebuild/run; SwiftData will now keep the schema synchronized across devices logged into the same iCloud account.

## Notifications
- Permission is requested on first launch (and refreshed when the scene becomes active).
- Booking creation triggers `NotificationManager.scheduleReminder`, which schedules a local notification 1 hour before the start.
- Cancelling/finishing bookings removes pending reminders.

## Payments (Apple Pay)
- `Payments/ApplePayService` wraps `PKPaymentAuthorizationController` so any booking can be paid directly from the bookings tab.
- Each booking row shows payment status and surfaces a native Apple Pay button when the device supports it.
- On success, the booking flips to `paymentStatus = .paid`; failures stay visible as `.failed` so the barber knows to retry or use another payment method.
- **Setup:** Apple Pay requires a valid merchant ID, certificate, and entitlement. Update `ApplePayConfiguration.merchantIdentifier` with your ID and enable the Apple Pay capability inside Xcode before distributing the app.

## Services Management
- The **Services** tab lists all offerings from SwiftData with add/edit/delete controls, so barbers can adjust pricing or durations without touching code.
- Duration steppers and price sliders ensure consistent values, and deletion automatically updates the SwiftData store.

## Alternative Payment Links & QR Codes
- The **Payments** tab lists quick links for Cash App, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, or any custom payment URL.
- Barbers can add/edit links, paste the share URL, and optionally attach a QR code from the camera or photo library for customers to scan.
- Each link row shows its QR preview (if provided) and an `Open` link that launches the payment page in Safari.

## Settings & Avatars
- The **Settings** tab lists all barbers with their bios and profile images.
- Tap `Change Photo` to capture or pick an avatar per barber; images are stored locally via `PhotoStorageService`.
- Removing a photo clears the stored file to keep disk usage low.
- Built-in links to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service keep the shop's legal language accessible inside the app.
- The repository also ships with a GitHub Pages–ready [Privacy Policy](docs/privacy-policy.md) so you can publish it externally (Settings ➜ Pages ➜ Source: `docs/`).

## Running the App
1. Open the `BarberBook` folder in Xcode 15 or newer.
2. Build & run on an iOS 17+ device/simulator.
3. Seed data appears automatically; use the UI to create bookings, manage the waitlist, upload haircut photos, and monitor loyalty progress.

Feel free to rename BarberBook later—the internal code references are already scoped so the product name is easy to change.
